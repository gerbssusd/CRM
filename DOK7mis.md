- ## **Verbs describe *types* of thinking** -- not depth of understanding or levels of cognitive engagement.

- ## **Verbs lack content:** verbs apply differently in different content areas.

- ## **Subjective Verbs:**  some verbs appear in multiple levels of Bloom's

- ## **The Complexity** of a task or activity comes **_AFTER_** the verb.
